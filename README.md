# arduino-multi-sensor-scanner
An Arduino Uno project that automatically scans multiple sensor types, detects their presence, and streams live diagnostic data over serial via a CP2102 USB-TTL adapter. Supports clap, obstacle, line tracking, touch, DHT11, HW-477, and HC-05 modules with modular testing code.

# Arduino Multi-Sensor Scanner

A modular Arduino Uno project that scans, detects, and reads multiple sensors one at a time, then streams diagnostic data through a CP2102 USB-TTL module. Designed for testing hardware setups in real time using PuTTY or any serial console.

---

## ✨ Features
- Auto-scans all connected sensors
- Serial output via CP2102 @ 9600 baud
- Supports:
  - CZN-15E clap sensor  
  - MH-Flying-Fish IR obstacle sensor  
  - DHT11 temperature/humidity  
  - Lafvin 3-sensor line tracker  
  - HC-05 BLE module (AT response check)  
  - Touch sensor (3-pin type)  
  - HW-477 Breakout IR sensor  
- Modular test functions for easy expansion
- Works with PuTTY, Arduino Serial Monitor, etc.

## 📦 Hardware Required
- Arduino Uno R3  
- CP2102 USB-to-TTL module  
- Any combination of supported sensors  
- Jumper wires  

---

## 🔧 Wiring Overview
### CP2102 → Arduino
TXD → RX (D0)
|
RXD → TX (D1)
|
GND → GND
|
5V → 5V (if Arduino USB/External Power not used)

### Notes
- Disconnect pins **RXD** and **TXD** before uploading firmware.
- HC-05 uses SoftwareSerial: `D10 = TX`, `D11 = RX`.

---

## 📜 Installation
1. Open the project in Arduino IDE.  
2. Select **Board → Arduino Uno**.  
3. Upload with a normal USB cable (ensure pins RXD/TXD are disconnected).  
4. Reconnect CP2102 and open PuTTY/Any serial Monitor at:
   - **Specific COM Port**
   - **9600 baud**
   - 8N1, no flow control

---

## ▶️ Usage
After boot, the Arduino cycles through all sensor types, printing:

- Whether each sensor responds  
- Raw readings for analog/digital modules  
- AT response from HC-05 (if connected)

---

## 🧩 Expanding the Project
You can easily add:
- More sensors  
- Logging to SD card  
- BLE streaming  
- Interactive serial menu  

Contributions welcome.
